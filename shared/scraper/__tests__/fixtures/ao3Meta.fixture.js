  description: `The crisis is over, the threat resolved, the day is saved. Or rather, there was never a crisis to begin with. Twilight Sparkle has saved the world, there is nothing left to do but tell the others what just happened. She has quite the story to tell, of memories only she has, of months that never happened, of the despair that nearly ended Equestria, and the hope that saved it.

In Equestria, Destiny is a very real thing. Everypony has one, emblazoned with a magic mark for all to see. It is a simple given fact that every pony finds their place in time, their own special destiny. Or is that law so immutable after all? Is being special always a good thing? In a society where destiny is real, what happens to the individual without one?

At the heart of Twilightâ€™s story is a single pony with a unique mark. The choices he made to try and fit in with the world have left him alone and miserable, and willing to go to insane lengths to find his place. When a chance meeting with Twilight gives him a chance he never thought he would have, his decisions come to have consequences far beyond what he could have imagined.

Maybe, just maybe, in the story of our lives we are not always the hero. Sometimes, we are the villain.`
