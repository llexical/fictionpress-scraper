    "He sees her all the time - but doesn't see her at all. She knew him as best as she could, but, doesn't know him at all. She saw him all the time, and yet, doesn't see him, never sees him. She saw passed him – passed everyone. He cares for her deeply, more than she will ever realize. He sees her all the time – but doesn't see her at all."
